            <h3>  The Problem </h3>
            <p>Making the transition into a large, pre-existing community can be challenging, with hundreds of new faces to meet,
                remember, and engage with. This was the experience for many at Waterlooâ€™s Chinese Christian Fellowship. After
                noticing that the environment was tailored heavily towards extroverts and people who preferred to initiate
                conversations, I was driven by a personal desire to aid myself and other more introverted people to find a
                solution.</p>
            
            <h3> The Concept </h3>
            <p>I settled on a speed friending program, the essence of which is to break down the vast community into smaller,
                more manageable groups where students could meet and interact. The idea was to create self-directed groups of
                four people each and change the groups every two weeks, with the goal of each group to meet up at least once
                over this two-week period. During these meetups, students would have an opportunity to introduce themselves,
                share their interests, and potentially identify common ground. This format was aimed at promoting inclusivity,
                removing the pressure of approaching others in a large crowd, and most importantly, creating a safe space where
                everyone could feel comfortable expressing themselves. A goal I also had was to increase the possibility of
                lasting friendships to be created due to the great amount of exposure people had to new individuals.</p>

            <h3>Automation</h3>
            <p>However, the task of organizing these events was far from straightforward. It required careful management and
                attention to detail to ensure that everyone had a chance to meet a diverse range of individuals. To manage this,
                I initially employed spreadsheets to manually arrange the speed friending groups. This involved juggling various
                factors such as the age and gender of participants, and whether or not they would be willing to step up to lead
                a group.</p>
            
            <p>While this method worked, it was highly time-consuming and labor-intensive. Seeing the need for a more efficient
                process, I decided to automate the group formation task. After self-learning Python, I developed a script that
                could automatically generate the groups for each event. This involved creating an algorithm that considered the
                same factors I had previously been manually juggling.</p>
            
            <p>The algorithm was able to sort groups in a way that assigned a leader to each group while minimizing minority
                genders in each group, favoring a combination of same-gender groups and equal-gender groups over an equal gender
                distribution across all the groups. As unity within the fellowship as a whole was a goal of the ministry, I
                programmed the algorithm to maximize the number of people in unique years in their university career in each
                group, improving inter-year friendships. In addition to optimizing various factors, this step significantly
                reduced the time and effort required in planning and allowed for a more accurate grouping based on multiple
                factors.</p>
            
            <h3>Legacy</h3>
            <p>The results of this program were overwhelmingly positive. The feedback received from the participants pointed
                towards the program's effectiveness in helping new students integrate into the larger community. Introverts found
                it especially helpful in generating friendships and meeting people in a low-pressure environment that did not
                require much initiation. Moreover, the initiative was praised for its innovative and entrepreneurial approach to
                fostering connections within the community. It proved so successful that it has been institutionalized within the
                fellowship, led by other students and continuing to be offered to the larger community on semesters that I am
                not on campus.</p>
