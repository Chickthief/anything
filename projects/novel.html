        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Since 2021, I have been working on a coming-of-age novel set in the competitive academic backdrop of an Asian-dominated community and following Jason Tang, an eleventh-grade student with Asperger's Syndrome. This story is written as a personal response to the perception of autism in the real world and to set right the poor portrayals of modern autistic characters.</p>
        <p>Initially, Jason feels his condition has impeded his success in this performance-oriented environment. His mundane life begins to shift when he joins a prestigious extra-curricular program designed to shape high school students into entrepreneurs and innovators. As Jason learns new skills and tries to find his place in the world, he grapples with the complexities of ambition, the meaning of friendship, and ultimately, the significance of autism and his identity.</p>
        <p>So far, the story has undergone two drafts, and I am currently writing the third. In addition to autism, I am also covering themes of success, masculinity, culture, and class.</p>

        <h3>Autism in the Real World</h3>
        <p>Mainstream media understandably overwhelms the idea of having autism with positive sentiment, but I believe this positive sentiment goes as far as to paint an inaccurate one-sided picture of a multidimensional disorder. Greta Thunberg, an autistic climate activist, referred to her diagnosis of autism as a superpower. Simply searching “Greta Thunberg autism” on Google only returns results that outline how this disorder has shaped her life for the better. Either Greta does not talk about her challenges with her diagnosis, or if she does, the search engine ignores it in favor of positivity. Both possibilities can be damaging to a balanced autistic self-image.</p>
        <p>Although autism can be a strength at times, the dark side of autism has yet to be uncovered in-depth, from a first-hand perspective. Many autistic people see their problems downplayed because today’s media echoes nothing but positivity, romanticizing the disorder rather than providing support. This novel breaks that norm with a more jaded interpretation of autism showing the grittiness of the everyday life of someone on the spectrum.</p>
        <p>I will be using identity-first language rather than person-first language as I believe autism is not just a diagnosis one has, but it is rather a part of one’s identity that defines every word they utter, every decision they make, and every step they take.</p>

        <h3>The Issue with Current Portrayals</h3>
        <p>My goal is to differ from poor representations of autism in recently-published novels. One such example is <em>A Curious Incident of The Dog In The Nighttime</em> by Mark Haddon. It is a detective novel about a teenager named Christopher who has Asperger’s Syndrome, a subtype of autism, and investigates the death of a dog in his neighborhood. Unfortunately, Christopher’s depiction was stereotyped and inaccurate, and his character was disempowered, putting the reader in a position of authority. This should not be the case in detective novels, especially not for a protagonist with a disability that was meant to be empowered. The author, who is neurotypical (non-autistic), originally marketed the book as a book centered around an autistic character. However, he later backpedaled and attempted to remove all traces of association between his book and Asperger’s Syndrome, writing in his blog that he in fact did no research on autism and knows very little about the subject. The damage was done and the book is still widely believed to have an autistic protagonist.</p>
        <p>Something else I aim to avert is the “Hollywood autism” trope, or the ideology surrounding autistic people, because that unfortunately covers the majority of autism portrayals. Autistic individuals in Hollywood are typically represented by a cisgender, straight, white, skinny male with an absence of empathy, emotions, and compassion. He is often seen as boring, nerdy, strange, annoying, and creepy, with no interest in mainstream interests like sports and relationships. He is also shown to either lead an unfulfilling life or be a supergenius, giving the impression that autistic people are incapable of leading a conventional life. Most frustratingly, autistic characters are frequently depicted to not also have other mental health disorders, when there is in fact a strong correlation between autism and mental health issues. Such a depiction makes it very easy for readers to interpret autism itself as the obstacle the character has to overcome, rather than the other issues that being autistic may bring.</p>
        <p>Unlike most other portrayals, Jason is Asian, has great emotional depth and feels a wide variety of emotions, is physically adept, and lives a comparatively conventional life. At his heart, Jason is still autistic, with an intense focus on his interests, difficulty regulating emotions, inferior social skills, and most importantly, feelings of inadequacy regarding his diagnosis.</p>
